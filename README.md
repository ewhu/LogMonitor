**LogMonitor** ================ Real-time Log Monitoring and Analysis for Efficient System Administration LogMonitor is a robust, scalable, and highly configurable log monitoring and analysis system designed to help system administrators and developers identify and troubleshoot issues in real-time. Built with performance and reliability in mind, LogMonitor provides a comprehensive platform for log collection, processing, and visualization, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and optimize system performance. The primary goal of LogMonitor is to simplify log analysis by providing a unified view of log data from diverse sources, including applications, servers, and devices. By leveraging advanced log processing and machine learning algorithms, LogMonitor enables users to detect anomalies, identify trends, and receive timely alerts and notifications. This enables proactive issue resolution, minimizing downtime, and improving overall system reliability. LogMonitor is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the system to their specific needs and requirements. With support for multiple log formats, customizable dashboards, and a robust API, LogMonitor provides a flexible and extensible platform for log analysis and monitoring. **Key Features** * Real-time log collection and processing from multiple sources, including syslog, log4j, and custom log formats * Advanced log parsing and filtering capabilities using Go's built-in regular expression engine * Support for multiple log storage backends, including Elasticsearch, MySQL, and MongoDB * Customizable dashboards with real-time log data visualization using D3.js and Chart.js * Robust API for integrating with third-party tools and services, including Slack, PagerDuty, and Nagios * Support for multiple alerting mechanisms, including email, SMS, and webhook notifications **Technology Stack** * Go programming language (1.17+) for building the LogMonitor application * golang.org/x/net/context for context-aware logging and error handling * github.com/json-iterator/go for high-performance JSON serialization and deserialization * github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql for MySQL database support * github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver for MongoDB database support * Elasticsearch 7.x for scalable log storage and search capabilities * D3.js and Chart.js for data visualization and dashboard creation **Installation** 1.
